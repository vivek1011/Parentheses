http://codeforces.com/problemset/gymProblem/100803/G - Flipping parentheses .
Logic : If you turn ( -> ) , then first occuring ) should be turned to ( . 
But if ) -> ( then find one minimum position so that minimum balance in range [finalposition , changedposition] >= 2 
So that if i change the balance at the finalposition then balance in this range must be greater than equal to 0. 
So that string must be balanced in this segment and hence overall segment . 

Find longest balanced brackets subsequence in a range .
